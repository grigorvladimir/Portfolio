Thare is not much that i can show hear, all my projects in past years were proproetary for Kamaz motor kompany,  
so i ended up adding one project that i did in university and one more that i did as traning/test for my work project

### DAC drivers for gd32

Is a basic Digital to analog convertor functions (initializations, deinitialization, set).  
Thats not much, but it is well structured and can give an idea of my approach to wrighting C code.
