# Portfolio Vladimir Grigorian

Thare is not much that i can show hear, all my projects in past years were  
proproetary for Kamaz motor kompany, so i ended up adding one project that  
I did in university and one more that i did as traning/test for my work project

### DAC drivers for gd32

Is a basic Digital to analog convertor functions (initializations, deinitialization, set).  
Thats not much, but it is well structured and can give an idea of  
my approach to wrighting C code.  
Most function are hear: DAC drivers for gd32/src/dac/dac.c

### Traction Control System

Is and elective project for computer sience course.   
I developed mycroprocesson sistem and wrote software for it using assembly language.  
Kp-580 was used which is a soviet copy of intel 82xx, and uses x86 instruction list.  
I tryed my best at translating this project for you.
