# Portfolio Vladimir Grigorian

There isn't a lot I can showcase here. Most of my projects in previous years were  
proprietary for Kamaz Motor Company. As a result, I've included one project I completed during  
my university studies and another one I worked on as part of a training/test for my job project.

### [DAC drivers for gd32](https://github.com/grigorvladimir/Portfolio/tree/main/DAC%20drivers%20for%20gd32)  
It's a basic Digital to analog convertor functions (initializations, deinitialization, set)  
writen for GD32, which is a chinese copy of stm32 microcontrollers (russian companys dont have excess to stm).  
Although it may not be extensive, this code is well-structured and can provide insight into my approach  
to writing C code. Most of the functions can be found here: DAC drivers for gd32/src/dac/dac.c

### [Traction Control System](https://github.com/grigorvladimir/Portfolio/blob/main/Traction%20control%20system.pdf)  
This an elective project for computer sience course.   
I undertook the development of a microprocessor system and authored software for it using assembly language.  
Microprocessor used is KP-580, a Soviet counterpart to the Intel 82xx, employing the x86 instruction set.  
I did my best to translate this project for you.
